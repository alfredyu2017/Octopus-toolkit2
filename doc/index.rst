Most of the current NGS analysis tools are developed to run on a Linux environment. The limitation of the current tools is that they are command line tools rather than GUIs.

Octopus-toolkit can allow biologist and other researchers to run NGS analysis without understanding of computation behind the tools.

Octopus-toolkit is a user friendly Chip-Seq and RNA-Seq analysis tool. It automatically downloads tools for Chip-Seq and RNA-Seq, and some reference genomes. It also automatically runs all the selected analysis of inputted GSE accession number.
